**Believe in Getter.**

## About
An extremely basic library for interfacing with Twitch's IRC server. Likely to 
break at any moment. Updates will be infrequent and will probably only happen 
when I notice it's broken.

## Dependencies
Python 3.6+, may work with earlier but I was developing on 3.6.2.\
